Bitmazk Pte. Ltd. Documentation
================================

We love open source software a lot. So we thought, we might just as well open
source our whole company.

This is an ongoing effort to document everything that we know about running our
company. If you think that we suck, please go ahead, fork us and send a pull
request. We are always eager to learn and to improve :)

We are not very good writers but we hope to turn this into a book at some point
in the future. Until then, you might read the latest version here:
