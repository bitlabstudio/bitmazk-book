Time Tracking
=============

We use [Freckle](http://letsfreckle.com) as our time tracking tool. It has
resonable pricing tiers and is one of the most beautiful, intuitive and useful
apps on the internet.

# People

Every employee has one account. Freelancers can also be added as users, they
are not able to see every project.

# Projects

For every project we create a project in Freckle. We don't aggregate several
projects from the same customer under one Freckle project, because then we
would start creating tags for sub-projects, which would ultimately end up in a
massive amount of tags and make reporting and invoicing more difficult.

# Tags

Every entry should have a tag. We try to keep the list of tags as short as
possible. If you are not sure about the available tags, just have a look at the
tags page on Freckle. If you think that we will need a new tag very often in
the future, announce it to the team and describe the reason.

Currently, we have the following tags:

TODO: Add tags here.
