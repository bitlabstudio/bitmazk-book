Time Tracking
=============

We use [Freckle](http://letsfreckle.com) as our time tracking tool. It has
resonable pricing tiers and is one of the most beautiful, intuitive and useful
apps on the internet.

# People

Every employee has one account. Freelancers can also be added as users, they
are not able to see every project.

# Projects

For every customer project we create a project in Freckle.

If one customer gives us several different projects, we would also create
several different projects in Freckle. In this case we would group the projects
alphabetically, by giving them similar names like ``CN: Foobar`` and
``CN: Barfoo`` (where ``CN`` is a shortcur for the customer name).

Additionally we add one project for our own company. When we have company
meetings that are not related to one specific project, we will track the time
here. 

Finally every team member get's their own project as well. When you are doing
some research about some new technology or working on a personal side-project
and you feel that the work could be (some day?) relevant for the company, you
can track your time here.

# Tags

Every entry should have a tag. We try to keep the list of tags as short as
possible. If you are not sure about the available tags, just have a look at the
tags page on Freckle. If you think that we will need a new tag very often in
the future, announce it to the team and describe the reason.

Currently, we have the following tags:

## django

This is the core competence of our company. Our day to day web development is
tracked under this tag. If the gros of your work was writing ``.py`` files, you
should probably tag it as ``#django``.

## html-css

This is the second most important tag that we have. It covers anything that
touches html, less, sass, css files.

## js

JavaScript and jQuery related tasks will be tagged as such.

## design

When doing work in Photoshop or just quickly creating vanilla Bootstrap markup
for a prototype, it should be tracked as ``#design``. 

## open-source

Sometimes we have to update old open-source apps or react to issues or
pull-requests. This is usually not covered by any customer budget, so it should 
be tracked as ``#open-source`` on the internal company project.

## documentation

As the name suggests, when time is spent writing documentation (usually user
manuals for the customer), it will be tagged as such.

## FREE*

Sometimes we are involved in a customer project but for some reason we don't
want to tag the task as billable hours. In these cases, we add the ``#FREE*``
tag to the other tag that describes the task.

## communication

Whenever we talk on IRC, Skype, Hangouts, phone, email or in person for an
extended amount of time, we tag the time as communication and roughly describe
what the conversation was about (just a few words).

## maintenance

This covers simple tasks like adding content to the CMS. Usually those are
tasks, that the customer could do themselves but for some reason prefers to
delegate the task to us.

## codereview

Like the name says. When we do codereviews for a colleague, we tag the time as
such.

## server

All tasks that are not real programming tasks but infrastructure tasks are
tagged as ``#server``. This includes setting up new Webfaction servers, adding
cronjobs, running deployments, restarting the webserver and so on.

## setup

When you need to mess around with your local development environment in order
to be able to start working, you can track this time with ``#setup``.

## research

When venturing into unknown territory where new technology needs to be used, a
lot of time is usually spent with trial and error, googling, reading READMEs,
setting up test-servers or local instances and so on. This time can be tagged
as ``#research``.

## finances

Time spent on updating our internal finance tracking app or creating and
sending invoices will be tagged as ``#finances``.

## acquisition

Time spent for answering emails to potential customers is tagges as
``#acquisition``.
