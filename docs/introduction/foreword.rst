Foreword
========

We are Bitmazk. We are beautifying bits and bytes.

Apart from our cool slogan, we don't have any best selling product.
We also don't have an evil plan to rule the world. All that we currently have
is integrity, passion, and a strong will to create products that amaze our
customers.

For a while this was enough to get this company started and it paid our bills
but we are reaching a point where our growth is outpacing our limited
capacities.

Suddenly we are facing an all new, interesting and challenging situation: We
have to think in decades rather than years and we have to start building up a
team.

Just: How do you build a team? We don't know. In fact, we don't even know what
exactly we have to offer for new team members. We know that we all are
incredibly proud and happy to do our work day after day, but we never tried to
put it into words.

This document is an ongoing effort to solve two problems:

* We want to find out who we are why we do this and what we have to offer
* We want to describe every little detail about our company so that anyone can
  figure out if he or she wants to work in this environment.

To some extend we are hereby open sourcing our whole company. We think that we
are good but we also know that we are not perfect. If you think that we suck,
`fork us on GitHub`_ and change our company (or start your own).
