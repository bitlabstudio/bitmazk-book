Our Mission
===========

If you aim for the impossible and reach just half of it, you are still going to
amaze a whole lot of people. Therefore our mission is at the same time
incredibly simple and seemingly incredibly hard to archieve:

We want to make the world a better place.

"Why do we want to do this?", you might ask.
"Why would anyone NOT want to do this?", we would answer.

Without any doubt we are living in an age of technology. Machines are
increasingly replacing humans, creating all kinds of problems:

* a global problem of unemployment
* an ever accelerating globalization
* an always increasing global energy consumption
* which leads to increasing exhaustion of natural ressources
* and global warming

Our generation might not have it's World War II but that doesn't matter. We
have global problems that might even be worse than that and while that sounds
like a horribly negative depiction of our times it is in fact a good thing:

During times of great risk there are always also great opportunities.

While our age of technology created a whole lot of problems it did also create
one increddible opportunity:

Knowledge is available almost for free, almost instantaneously and information
can "go viral" and travel accros the globe in a matter of hours. Ideas can be
turned into prototypes without large amounts of investment capital or massive
production sites. Think about Open Source. Think about startups that turn into
billion dollar companies and render established corporations obsolete.
Think about the Arab Spring. Think about Wikileaks.

In short: In human histroy there has never been a time where one individual had
more power to make a global impact. This is the huge opportunity of our
generation.

We believe that when given financial security and the possibility to make free
decisions it is inherent in every human to do something and to do something
good in particular.

At Bitmazk we are trying to create an environment where each member has the
opportunity to grow as an individual, to live on this planet with their eyes
open, to identify meaningful problems and to provide lasting solutions.

Ironically the ever accelerating technological revolution threatens humanity on
many levels: evironmental, physically, psychologically, ethically but
at the same time it has raised the average standard of living so much that it
allows each and every one of us to the one thing that is truely human:

Making the world a better place.
